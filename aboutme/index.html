    <h2>Romeo Butuyan II</h2>
    <h2>(Asia's Freddie Mercury)</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! You can simply call me by my first name, Romeo. I am 21 years old and I live in Metro Manila, Philippines. I consider myself as a tech noob. I just finished PathwayConnect and this is my first week as a college student.</p>
    <p>I am a failed songwriter, because I can only write a verse and a chorus at most. Nonetheless, I love music and I love performing. My all-time favorite rock band is Queen, which is a bit of a given considering what I wrote as my nickname above.</p>
    <p>I hope to become a successful entrepreneur in the technology sector one day and finally lift myself up from the incoveniences of poverty.</p>
